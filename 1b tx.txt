Theory: 
The shell 
The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt .The adept user can customize his/her own shell and users can use different shells on the same machine. Unix system offers verity of shells like 1) Bourne shell 2) c shell 3) Korn shell 4) Bash shell (very powerful & recommended for use, Linux default shell) 
History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you need to repeat a command, use  the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list or type history for a list of previous commands. 
Shell Script 
Normally shells are interactive. It means shell accept command from you (via keyboard) and execute them.  But if you use command one by one (sequence of 'n' number of commands), then you can store this sequence of command to text file and tell the shell to execute this text file instead of entering the commands. This is known as shell script. Shell Script is series of command written in plain text file. This manual is meant as a brief introduction to features found in Bash.
